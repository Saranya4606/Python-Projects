# Python Projects – Saranya

This repository contains my basic Python practice projects that solve simple real-life problems.

## 1. Time Clock (`timeclock.py`)

This script displays the time based on the region/country selected by the user.  
It is useful for long-distance communication – for example, when someone in India wants to call family or friends in the USA but does not know the exact time there.

**Features:**
- Takes region/timezone as input.
- Shows the correct local time for that region.
- Helps avoid calling people at odd or inconvenient hours.

## 2. Math Utility (`math.py`)

This script performs different math-related operations based on user input.

**Features:**
- Accepts numbers and/or text-based options as input.
- Calculates results for selected operations (for example: basic arithmetic, other math functions).
- Displays the output clearly along with an explanation of what was calculated.

## Purpose

These projects are mainly for:
- Practicing Python.
- Learning how to use Git and GitHub.
- Building a base for future, more advanced projects (AI, automation, etc.).
